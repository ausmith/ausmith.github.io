    title: About Me
    summary: |
      An experienced engineer and engineering manager on teams building and 
      maintaining internal developer platforms. My primary interests lie in 
      DevOps/SRE leaning teams focused on providing engineers with tools and 
      platforms to make delivering value fast, easy, and secure by default. 
      The values that have enabled my success are: my penchant for clear 
      communication, desire to understand the whole of any given system, and 
      tapping into people’s passions to inspire and engage them in the workplace.
