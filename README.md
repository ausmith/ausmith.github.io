# Resume

Pretty much exactly what the title says. This repository is my resume.

## But why the full repo?

This is an application that will display the different parts of my resume within
a webapp. I wanted to play around with Node.js while turning my resume into an
easily parsable format.

Once complete, this project will display the contents of the resume as well as
provide documentation for any endpoints provided in a styling that is similar to
API documentation.

## First attempt

This is my first time messing with Node.js and generally with doing javascript
programming, so please excuse any coding practices that are against the
typical advice of the community and advise on how to rectify instead.

## Thank you for your interest!

Really, thank you so much for being interested in looking at this repo, any
help with improving it will help me improve as coder!
